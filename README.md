My goals are:
- [ ] Develop a personal Website. 
- [ ] Create a portfolio.
- [ ] Build my coding skills.

I'm learning to code at [Freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org).

I'm currently strengthening my coding skills in **HTML,** **CSS,** and **JavaScript.**

I have found a passion for web development and complex problem solving using critical thinking. I'm looking to break into the field and I'm currently enrolled at [Devry](https://www.devry.com) in a web design and development program. 

This is my first time using plain text markup! How did I do?
